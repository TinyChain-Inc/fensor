# fensor
A filesystem-backed `Tensor` data structure featuring support for dense and sparse indexing

## Data Integrity Policy

`fensor` is fail-closed on corruption.

- `fensor` does not attempt to repair, recover, or auto-heal corrupted metadata or tensor data.
- If metadata or data is malformed, inconsistent, or unreadable, operations must return a structured error with a clear message.
- Recovery workflows (restore/rebuild/migration) are external operational concerns, not `fensor` runtime behavior.
